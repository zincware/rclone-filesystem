# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-06)

**Core value:** Any rclone-supported remote is usable as a first-class fsspec filesystem
**Current focus:** Phase 1: Path Infrastructure and Protocol Registration

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Path Infrastructure and Protocol Registration)
Plan: 3 of 3 in current phase
Status: Executing

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5-phase layer-by-layer approach: path infra -> file I/O -> listing/cache -> transfers -> polish
- [Phase 01]: Used module-level _endpoint_uri variable to share dynamic endpoint between fixtures
- [Phase 01-01]: Path validation uses frozenset intersection; error messages show bad chars not full path (security)
- [Phase 01-01]: _validate_path is @staticmethod for testability
- [Phase 01-02]: _strip_protocol handles both colon and slash separators for rclone URL forms
- [Phase 01-02]: _get_kwargs_from_urls returns empty dict for non-rclone URLs

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- rclone binary version needs to be determined before Phase 5 CI pinning
- FileNotFoundError detection strategy (empty dir vs non-existent) needs validation in Phase 3
